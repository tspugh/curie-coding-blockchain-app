# Strict-review findings — tick 8 (UNIT-3, partd-approvable)

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Scope:** the 6 files newly added this tick:
- `demo-data/scenarios/partd-approvable/note.md`
- `demo-data/scenarios/partd-approvable/packet.json`
- `demo-data/scenarios/partd-approvable/payer-profile.json`
- `demo-data/scenarios/partd-approvable/requested-drug.json`
- `demo-data/scenarios/partd-approvable/expected-outcome.md`
- `src/protocol/scenarios.partd-approvable.test.ts`

R-citations the unit claims to satisfy: SPEC-0004 §2.1 R1, R2 (partial — 1 of 3),
R4; §2.3 R10; §3.2 (PartD `formularyRelease` discriminant); §3.4 (packet shape).

---

## Second pass (2026-05-29, after first-pass fixes)

Test status: `node --import tsx --test src/protocol/scenarios.partd-approvable.test.ts`
passes 6/6.

### First-pass closure check

| # | Severity | Description (short) | Status |
|---|----------|---------------------|--------|
| 1 | MEDIUM | `_note` references non-existent `scripts/pin-formulary.ts` | **CLOSED** — `_note` field removed from `payer-profile.json`; file now contains exactly `{payerLine, planId, formularyRelease}` per §3.2. |
| 2 | MEDIUM | `_note` underscore-prefix-as-inline-doc antipattern | **CLOSED** — same edit as #1. `payer-profile.json` is now a clean §3.2 shape with no extraneous keys. |
| 3 | LOW | Test doesn't assert `submittedAt`/`submittedBy` from §3.4 | **CLOSED-WITH-CAVEAT** — both fields are now asserted (lines 142-153). See new finding NEW-1 below: the `submittedAt` assertion is broader than §3.4 specifies. |
| 4 | LOW | Defensive fallback for `references` field rename | **CLOSED** — fallback removed; test now reads `packet["references"]` directly (lines 127-128) and fails loudly on rename. |
| 5 | LOW | PHI-scan regex set narrower than R1 rationale | **CLOSED** — three regexes added at test lines 42-59 covering phone (`NNN-NNN-NNNN`, `NNN.NNN.NNNN`, `(NNN) NNN-NNNN`), email, and MRN with 7+ contiguous digits. The synthetic `MRN 000-PARTD-001` slips correctly (3 digits before the dash); the inline comment at lines 53-54 documents the deliberate slip. No false-positive on the synthetic NDC `00074-3799-02` (5-4-2 shape, doesn't match the 3-3-4 phone pattern) or on `2026-01-01` date (4-2-2 shape). |
| 6 | LOW | R2 partial-coverage bookkeeping | **DEFERRED (out of scope)** — flagged for `loop-state.md`, not a code-review concern. Acknowledged. |

### NEW findings introduced by the fix edits

#### NEW-1 LOW | `submittedAt` assertion is broader than §3.4 `Packet` type allows

- `src/protocol/scenarios.partd-approvable.test.ts:142-147`
- §3.4 line 456 defines `submittedAt: number;` — strictly a number, not a
  number-or-string union. The fixture (`packet.json:39`) uses `1748563200`
  (a number), which passes the test via the number branch.
- The current assertion accepts EITHER a positive finite number OR a non-empty
  string:
  ```ts
  assert.ok(
    (typeof submittedAt === "number" && Number.isFinite(submittedAt) && submittedAt > 0) ||
      (typeof submittedAt === "string" && submittedAt.length > 0),
    "packet.submittedAt must be a positive number (unix seconds) or non-empty string (ISO)",
  );
  ```
- Why it matters: this is a *contract* test pinning §3.4. A future fixture that
  lands with `"submittedAt": "2026-05-30T00:00:00Z"` (ISO string) would pass
  the test but fail the §3.4 typed schema — exactly the failure mode the
  first-pass Finding #3 was meant to prevent. The fix tightened the contract
  on `submittedBy` correctly but loosened it on `submittedAt`.
- Severity rationale: LOW because (a) the current fixture uses a number, so
  there's no actual mismatch today, and (b) any production code consuming the
  JSON via the §3.4 `Packet` type would reject a string at the type boundary
  anyway. But the test's job is to be the early-detection layer; accepting
  strings undermines that.
- Suggested fix: tighten to number-only:
  ```ts
  assert.ok(
    typeof submittedAt === "number" && Number.isFinite(submittedAt) && submittedAt > 0,
    "packet.submittedAt must be a positive number (unix seconds) per §3.4",
  );
  ```

### Regression checks (no findings)

- **Removal of `_note` from `payer-profile.json`:** no other code or test
  references that key. Grep across `src/` and `scripts/` confirms zero
  consumers. The two preexisting underscore-prefixed-key fixtures
  (`demo-data/formulary-part-d.json:_comment`,
  `demo-data/fda-indication-adalimumab.json:_curie_note`) are unrelated files
  and were not touched.
- **Removal of the defensive `references` fallback:** the fixture's
  `packet.json` uses the literal field name `references` (line 2). The test
  now reads `packet["references"]` directly. Passes. If §3.4 ever renames
  the field, the test fails loudly with "must have a top-level `references`
  array (SPEC-0004 §3.4)" — exactly the desired behavior.
- **New phone regex against the synthetic NDC `00074-3799-02`:** the regex
  requires `\d{3}[-.]\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}` (3-3-4 digit pattern). The NDC is
  5-4-2, doesn't match. No false-positive.
- **New phone regex against dates `2026-01-01`:** 4-2-2 digit pattern, doesn't
  match. No false-positive.
- **New email regex against `note.md`:** the note contains no `@` symbol. No
  false-positive.
- **New MRN regex against the synthetic `MRN 000-PARTD-001`:** the regex
  requires `MRN` followed by 7+ contiguous digits. The synthetic value has
  only 3 digits (`000`) before the `-PARTD` text breaks the digit run.
  Slips correctly. Test passes.
- **`submittedBy` regex `/^0x[0-9a-fA-F]{40}$/`:** the fixture's
  `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001` is 0x + 40 hex characters.
  Matches. Correct.

### Carried-over OK items (unchanged from first pass)

- `planId` vs `planIdOrProduct` divergence: test asserts `planId` per §3.2.
- `partd-approvable` scenario reasoning maps to Approve cleanly under R6/R22/R24.
- `submittedBy: 0x…0001` placeholder address acceptable for fixture.
- `contentHash = keccak256("0x")` correct as the empty-bytes well-known hash.
- Test comments are minimal and substantive (PayerLine enum guard, §3.2/R8
  divergence note); no decorative comments.
- Unused imports: none.
- `expected-outcome.md` math (`min(5200, 2100 × 2) = 4200`) matches R24.
- Test isolation: `node:test` + `node:assert/strict`, matches project convention.

---

## Second pass — OVERALL: FAIL (now CLOSED in third pass below)

All 6 first-pass findings addressed; one NEW LOW (NEW-1) introduced by the fix to
finding #3. See third-pass closure below.

---

## Third pass (2026-05-29, after NEW-1 fix)

NEW-1 closed inline: `src/protocol/scenarios.partd-approvable.test.ts:142-146`
now reads:

```ts
const submittedAt = packet["submittedAt"];
assert.ok(
  typeof submittedAt === "number" && Number.isFinite(submittedAt) && submittedAt > 0,
  `packet.submittedAt must be a positive number (unix seconds per §3.4); got ${typeof submittedAt}`,
);
```

This matches §3.4 line 456 exactly (`submittedAt: number;`). The string-branch is
gone — an ISO-string fixture would now fail loudly with the §3.4 citation in the
assertion message. Test re-run: `node --import tsx --test "src/**/*.test.ts"`
returns 27/27 green (UNIT-3 contributes 6, unchanged count).

No additional code edits beyond the NEW-1 fix; no other findings can be reasonably
introduced by tightening one type union to a single type, so the third pass is a
documentation-only confirmation.

### Third-pass OVERALL: PASS — 0 findings

All first-pass findings closed in code (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5) or deferred to loop
bookkeeping (#6 — R2 partial-coverage marker, handled in `loop-state.md`). NEW-1
closed in code. No new findings introduced by the third-pass fix.

# Strict-review findings — tick 9 (UNIT-3b, commercial-policy-void)

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Scope:** the 6 files newly added this tick:
- `demo-data/scenarios/commercial-policy-void/note.md`
- `demo-data/scenarios/commercial-policy-void/packet.json`
- `demo-data/scenarios/commercial-policy-void/payer-profile.json`
- `demo-data/scenarios/commercial-policy-void/requested-drug.json`
- `demo-data/scenarios/commercial-policy-void/expected-outcome.md`
- `src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts`

R-citations the unit claims to satisfy: SPEC-0004 §2.1 R1, R2 (partial — 2 of 3),
R4; §2.3 R10; §3.2 (Commercial `formularyRelease` discriminant); §3.4 (packet
shape); §2.6 R23 (policy-void rule); SPEC-0001 R6a/R6b.

Test status: `node --import tsx --test src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts`
returns 6/6 green. Full-suite re-run returns 33/33 green (27 prior + 6 new),
matching the expected delta.

---

## Findings

### Finding 1 — HIGH | `slice.kind: "policy-clause"` is not in the §3.4 enum

- `demo-data/scenarios/commercial-policy-void/packet.json:20`
- `src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:160,164`
- **Description:** the second EvidenceReference (Aetna CPB 0792) carries
  `slice.kind === "policy-clause"`. SPEC-0004 §3.4 (lines 446-451) defines the
  `slice.kind` union as exactly:
  ```ts
  kind?: "fda-label-indication" | "fda-label-contraindication"
       | "guideline-recommendation" | "formulary-entry" | "price-benchmark";
  ```
  `"policy-clause"` is **not** in this union. The test then **asserts** that at
  least one reference carries `"policy-clause"` — locking in a value the typed
  schema rejects. This is the structural mirror of the prior `planIdOrProduct`
  finding: a load-bearing slice tag that the typed contract refuses.
- **Why it matters:** the fixture violates §3.4's typed contract on the
  load-bearing reference (the one R23 routes off of). When this packet is
  ingested through a `Packet` typed boundary (the Curie packet-store write
  Lambda per §3.3, or any TS consumer typed to `EvidenceReference`), TypeScript
  excess-property checks pass `slice.kind` as `string | undefined` only for the
  literal-union members; a `"policy-clause"` literal in a freshly-decoded
  `Packet` value would either be silently widened away or fail compile under
  `--strict` if the consumer narrows on `kind`. The arbiter's R23 detection
  (which §3.4 implicitly says routes off the `fda-label-indication` slice +
  some textual contradiction signal) has no typed name for "policy clause".
  R23's prose talks about "policy-quote leaves" (line 369) — also not a
  defined kind.
- **Suggested fix:** EITHER (a) extend the §3.4 union to include `"policy-clause"`
  (or `"policy-quote"` to match R23's wording) via an amendment, then update
  the fixture and the test together; OR (b) drop the `kind` field on the
  policy reference (it is optional) and have the test assert
  `slice.text.length > 0` for the policy reference instead of pinning a kind
  that doesn't exist. Option (a) is the right structural fix because the
  arbiter needs a typed signal to detect "this is the clause R23 voids";
  option (b) preserves §3.4 conformance at the cost of leaving the policy
  reference structurally indistinguishable from any other text slice.

### Finding 2 — HIGH | Expected ruling (`PolicyInvalidated`) contradicts SPEC-0004 R23 / T9

- `demo-data/scenarios/commercial-policy-void/expected-outcome.md:1-3,27-30`
- **Description:** the expected-outcome.md routes this case to terminal
  `PolicyInvalidated` (SPEC-0001 R6b path). SPEC-0004 §2.6 R23 says the arbiter
  MUST rule **`Approve`** and emit `policyVoidedClauseIndices: number[]` in
  the ruling payload — i.e., the policy clause is voided but the request is
  *approved* (with R24 cost-band settlement on top), not terminally rejected.
  SPEC-0004 T9 (line 579-581) explicitly names this scenario:
  > T9 (R23, policy-void): the `commercial-policy-void` case's ruling carries
  > `policyVoidedClauseIndices` listing the offending clause; the timeline
  > renders the voided-clause annotation.
  T9 nowhere mentions terminal PolicyInvalidated.
- The fixture cites both R6b (SPEC-0001) and R23 (SPEC-0004) as joint
  authority for the PolicyInvalidated terminal ruling, but these two rules
  *disagree* on the outcome. SPEC-0001 R6b: `PolicyFlagged` + terminal
  `PolicyInvalidated`. SPEC-0004 R23: `Approve` + `policyVoidedClauseIndices`.
- The project's `docs/progress/loop-state.md:26` *did* prescribe
  `PolicyInvalidated` as the expected ruling for this scenario — but loop-state
  is operational bookkeeping, not a spec amendment. No `docs/amendments/A-NNNN`
  resolves the R23-vs-R6b conflict in favor of one or the other.
- **Why it matters:** this is the SPEC-0002 set-piece (per R23 line 372). When
  the demo lands, it will either (a) approve via R23 and contradict the
  expected-outcome.md, or (b) terminally reject via R6b and contradict
  SPEC-0004 T9 + R23. The fixture has committed the project to outcome (b)
  without resolving the spec conflict; whichever the arbiter does, one spec
  test ("T9 renders the voided-clause annotation") will fail.
- **Suggested fix:** author a `docs/amendments/A-NNNN-policy-void-ruling.md`
  that picks one of:
  1. **R6b wins** (matches fixture): SPEC-0004 R23 and T9 are amended to route
     to terminal `PolicyInvalidated` (no Approve, no settlement); T9 is rewritten
     to test for the `PolicyInvalidated` event + `clauseRef`/`standardRef`
     payload rather than `policyVoidedClauseIndices`.
  2. **R23 wins** (matches SPEC-0004 T9): SPEC-0001 R6b is amended to make
     `PolicyFlagged` an annotation on the `Approved` event rather than a
     route to a separate terminal; the fixture's expected-outcome.md is
     rewritten to `Approve` with `policyVoidedClauseIndices: [1]` and an R24
     settlement amount.
  Either is defensible; the fixture cannot stand without one being adopted.

### Finding 3 — MEDIUM | Test name and class-doc mis-cite §3.4 for the policy-clause invariant

- `src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:6-7,120`
- **Description:** the test's docstring (line 6-7) says "Also asserts the
  policy-clause reference invariant: at least one reference must carry
  slice.kind === 'policy-clause'." and the test name (line 120) is
  `"...packet.json has references[], submittedAt, submittedBy, and a
  policy-clause reference"`. Both attribute the invariant to §3.4 by
  proximity, but §3.4 does not name `"policy-clause"` (Finding 1). The
  inline comment at line 156-157 correctly cites SPEC-0004 §2.6 R23 as the
  source.
- **Why it matters:** the test name and the test docstring read as a §3.4
  contract assertion (this is the section the test claims to lock in). A
  reviewer reading the test name will look up §3.4, fail to find
  `"policy-clause"`, and either weaken the test or amend §3.4 sight unseen.
  The header text is the wrong citation for this load-bearing claim.
- **Suggested fix:** rename the test to
  `"UNIT-3b commercial-policy-void §2.6 R23 — packet.json carries a policy-clause reference (load-bearing for R23 policy-void detection)"`
  or split the policy-clause assertion into a sibling test that cites §2.6 R23
  cleanly. The §3.4 packet-shape assertions (references[], submittedAt,
  submittedBy) belong in their own test, separate from the R23 invariant.
  Couples cleanly with Finding 1's fix.

### Finding 4 — MEDIUM | `expected-outcome.md` PHI guards do not apply to this file (gap with note.md scan)

- `src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:32-67`
- **Description:** the PHI-marker scan (SSN, MM/DD/YYYY DOB, driver-license,
  phone, email, MRN≥7-digit) runs against `note.md` only. The same scan does
  not run against `expected-outcome.md`, which is also synthetic narrative
  content authored alongside the note. The partd test made the same choice
  (only `note.md` is scanned), so this is mirrored — not drift — but it
  remains a gap.
- **Why it matters:** R1 is "synthetic only" applied to *all* curated content,
  not solely the note. A future author who pastes a real PHI string into
  expected-outcome.md (or a future reasoning-trace template) bypasses the
  scan. Today the file is clean (I read it; no PHI shapes), so this is a
  prospective gap not an active leak.
- **Suggested fix:** factor the PHI-scan into a small shared helper (matches
  Finding 7's DRY concern) and apply it to both `note.md` and
  `expected-outcome.md`. Two extra `fs.readFileSync` lines and one shared
  regex pass — small cost, closes the gap.

### Finding 5 — LOW | `"Approve" keyword ordering` heuristic is brittle for future fixture authors

- `src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:183-190`
- **Description:** the assertion checks that the first occurrence of
  `PolicyInvalidated`/`PolicyInvalid` (regex case-insensitive) appears at or
  before the first occurrence of bare `Approve`/`APPROVE` (regex
  case-sensitive). The current expected-outcome.md contains:
  - "FDA-approved" (lowercase `approved` — does not match `\bApprove\b`
    because the trailing `\b` requires non-word after `Approve`, but `d` is
    word-class; verified no match)
  - no other `Approve`/`APPROVE` strings
  So the assertion passes vacuously today (`firstApprove === null`, the
  conditional branch is skipped).
- **Why it matters:** the heuristic is fragile in two ways. (1) A reasonable
  future addition like "the arbiter would not Approve this request" *would*
  trip `\bApprove\b` and then require ordering relative to PolicyInvalidated
  — the assertion would silently pass if PolicyInvalidated happens to appear
  first, even though the sentence's semantics are inverted. (2) An author
  who writes "APPROVE: no — terminal PolicyInvalidated" in a heading hits
  the failure mode the test is supposed to prevent. The ordering heuristic
  is not robust to the ways humans actually write expected-outcome docs.
- **Suggested fix:** replace the keyword-ordering heuristic with a positive
  assertion on the "Expected outcome:" header line:
  ```ts
  const headerLine = content.split("\n").find((l) => /^##\s*Expected outcome:/i.test(l));
  assert.ok(headerLine, "expected-outcome.md must have an '## Expected outcome:' header");
  assert.ok(
    /PolicyInvalidated|PolicyInvalid/.test(headerLine!),
    "the '## Expected outcome:' header must name PolicyInvalidated as the expected ruling",
  );
  assert.ok(
    !/\bApprove\b/.test(headerLine!),
    "the '## Expected outcome:' header must not name 'Approve' (expected ruling is PolicyInvalidated)",
  );
  ```
  This pins the load-bearing claim (the header line) without a fragile
  global-ordering heuristic. Matches the way the fixture is actually
  structured (line 1: `## Expected outcome: PolicyInvalidated`).

### Finding 6 — LOW | `submittedBy: 0x...0002` sentinel pattern is undocumented

- `demo-data/scenarios/commercial-policy-void/packet.json:40`
- `demo-data/scenarios/partd-approvable/packet.json:40` (peer)
- **Description:** the partd fixture uses `0x...0001`, this fixture uses
  `0x...0002`. The intent appears to be "per-scenario distinct sentinel
  address". The pattern is sensible but is not documented anywhere — no
  spec, no README, no comment. A future fixture author has no signal that
  the address must be distinct vs. that it must follow an enumerated
  sequence vs. that it doesn't matter at all.
- **Why it matters:** structural-invariant patterns without documentation
  rot fast. If a third fixture lands with `0x...0001` again, no test
  catches it; if one lands with `0xdeadbeef...`, no test catches it. The
  pattern is load-bearing if any consumer keys behavior off `submittedBy`
  (replay, audit, dedup), and load-bearing patterns need an asserted home.
- **Suggested fix:** EITHER (a) drop the pattern (treat `submittedBy` as
  opaque, any valid 20-byte address); OR (b) document the convention in
  `demo-data/scenarios/README.md` (which does not yet exist — create it)
  with an enumeration: `partd-approvable → 0x…01`, `commercial-policy-void →
  0x…02`, `medicaid-policy-void → 0x…03`. A small README plus a test that
  cross-validates scenario-slug → address mapping would lock it in. The
  cheapest fix is (a); (b) is justified only if the demo replay actually
  depends on distinct addresses.

### Finding 7 — LOW | ~80% structural overlap between the two scenario test files warrants extraction

- `src/protocol/scenarios.partd-approvable.test.ts` vs.
  `src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts`
- **Description:** the two files share:
  - Identical PHI-scan regex set (7 patterns).
  - Identical packet-shape assertions (references[], submittedAt,
    submittedBy, contentHash regex).
  - Identical requested-drug field iteration (`["ndc", "rxnormCui", "name",
    "dose", "requestedFor"]` + qty branch).
  - Identical scenario-file existence loop.
  - Identical `__filename` + `PROJECT_ROOT` boilerplate.
  Only the §3.2 discriminant block (PartD vs Commercial fields) and the
  expected-outcome assertions differ.
- **Why it matters:** the loop rules ("three similar lines is fine; copy-paste
  at the file level may warrant extraction") apply at the file level here.
  With UNIT-3c (medicaid scenario) presumably landing next, the codebase
  will have three near-identical files. Any future change (a new PHI
  regex; a §3.4 schema addition; a stricter contentHash check) will need
  to be made three times and is one missed-edit away from silent drift.
  The "regression check" sections in the tick 8 review are already
  enumerating the same regexes twice — a smell.
- **Suggested fix:** extract a shared helper module
  `src/protocol/scenarioFixtures.test-helpers.ts` (or `.ts` if you prefer
  it as test-only library code) exposing:
  - `assertNoPHI(content: string, context: string)` — the 7-regex scan.
  - `assertPacketShape(packet: unknown)` — the §3.4 invariants.
  - `assertRequestedDrugShape(drug: unknown)` — the field iteration.
  - `loadScenarioFile(slug: string, name: string): string` — the path resolution.
  Each per-scenario test file then becomes ~40 lines of *scenario-distinct*
  assertions (the discriminant + the expected-outcome + the
  scenario-specific reference invariant). DRY without sacrificing the
  per-scenario test names that show up in the TAP output. Defer the
  extraction to a dedicated refactor commit so this UNIT-3b tick stays
  focused.

### Finding 8 — LOW | Dead `_filename` constant in both tests

- `src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:19-20`
- `src/protocol/scenarios.partd-approvable.test.ts:17-18` (peer)
- **Description:** `const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);` is
  computed once and consumed exactly once (the very next line:
  `PROJECT_ROOT = path.resolve(path.dirname(__filename), "..", "..")`). The
  named binding adds no readability over inlining
  `path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))`.
- **Why it matters:** strict-stickler nit. The binding mimics the CJS
  `__filename` builtin in ESM, which is a recognized pattern, so I'd let
  it stand on idiom grounds. But the *prefix `__`* signals "magic builtin"
  to a reader who doesn't know this is hand-rolled; in CJS it's
  module-provided. Mild lying-by-naming.
- **Suggested fix:** either inline the expression (saves one line) or rename
  to `currentFile` to remove the false-builtin signal. Defer; this is the
  bottom of the priority list.

### Finding 9 — LOW | `requested-drug.json` test name says "six required fields", asserts five strings + one number

- `src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:100,106`
- `src/protocol/scenarios.partd-approvable.test.ts:99,105` (peer — same bug)
- **Description:** the test name says "all six required fields"; the
  iteration covers 5 string fields (`ndc, rxnormCui, name, dose,
  requestedFor`) + the `quantity` branch separately, total 6 fields. So the
  count is right, but reading the name alongside the loop body
  (`["ndc", "rxnormCui", "name", "dose", "requestedFor"]` — 5 items) makes
  the name look off by one. Trivially confusing.
- **Why it matters:** comment/name vs. code mismatch in apparent count. A
  reader who counts the array items will doubt the test. Pure aesthetics.
- **Suggested fix:** rename to "...has five string fields and a numeric
  quantity" or to "...has all six fields per R4". Trivial.

## Symmetry / regression checks (no findings)

- **`payer-profile.json` shape:** exactly `{payerLine, formularyRelease}`
  with `formularyRelease` carrying exactly
  `{line, carrier, product, revision, sourceUrl, contentHash}`. No `_note`
  field (tick 8's antipattern did not re-introduce). No `planId` field
  (correctly disjoint from PartD discriminant). Matches §3.2 Commercial
  union exactly.
- **`Patient B` synthetic marker:** distinct from partd's `Patient A`. The
  commercial test's regex `/synthetic|fictional|Patient B/i` matches the
  note (line 10, 41) and does NOT match the partd note (which uses
  "Patient A" — verified the regex would fail there if pointed at the
  wrong folder; the partd test reciprocally uses `/synthetic|fictional|Patient A/i`).
  Cross-folder false-positive impossible because both tests hardcode their
  `SCENARIO_DIR` paths.
- **Policy-clause contradiction with FDA label is real:** the note documents
  "soft-tissue swelling without erosive changes" + "MRI…has not been
  ordered" (note.md:15-17). The Aetna CPB 0792 slice requires "erosive
  changes, or MRI demonstrating bone marrow edema" (packet.json:19). The
  FDA-label slice (packet.json:7) carries "psoriatic arthritis" with no
  imaging prerequisite. The three texts line up cleanly for the R23
  contradiction.
- **`contentHash` uniformity:** all three references in packet.json carry
  the same hash (`0xc5d2…a470` = keccak256 of empty bytes, per tick 8). Same
  placeholder pattern as partd. Acceptable as fixture-tier; would need real
  hashes for a non-demo deploy.
- **Test isolation:** `node:test` + `node:assert/strict`, matches project
  convention.
- **No mocks:** all five fixture files are read from disk; no test doubles.
- **Test count:** 33 total (27 prior + 6 new). Verified by full-suite re-run.
  No test skipped, deduplicated, or failed.
- **Lying comments / dead code:** none beyond Finding 8's `__filename` nit
  and Finding 9's name-vs-count nit.

## Tick-9 verdict (first pass)

**OVERALL: FAIL — 9 findings (2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 5 LOW)**

The two HIGH findings are spec-conformance gaps, not stylistic. Finding 1
(`"policy-clause"` not in §3.4 enum) is a typed-contract violation on the
load-bearing reference. Finding 2 (R23-vs-R6b conflict) is a deeper
spec-level inconsistency that the fixture commits one resolution to without
an amendment; whichever the arbiter does, one spec test will eventually
break. Both should be resolved (via §3.4 enum amendment + R23/R6b amendment,
in that order) before this scenario is wired into an end-to-end run.

The MEDIUM findings (test name mis-cite, PHI-scan coverage gap) and LOW
findings (heuristic brittleness, sentinel-address convention, DRY at the
file level, `__filename` nit, field-count name) are individually small but
collectively flag that this tick mirrored partd's structure faithfully —
including its problems. Tick 8's strict review missed Findings 4, 5, 7,
8, 9 because they all manifest as "symmetric in both files"; this tick
exposes them.

## Tick-9 SECOND PASS (2026-05-29, after fixes)

Test status: `node --import tsx --test "src/**/*.test.ts"` returns **36/36
green** (was 33 at first pass; +3 as expected — R23-invariant test split into
its own sibling, partd's new R1 expected-outcome PHI test, commercial's new
R1 expected-outcome PHI test). Matches the prompt's predicted delta exactly.

### First-pass closure check

| # | Severity | Description (short) | Status |
|---|----------|---------------------|--------|
| 1 | HIGH | `slice.kind: "policy-clause"` not in §3.4 enum | **CLOSED** — `packet.json:20` now reads `"kind": "guideline-recommendation"` (an allowed §3.4 enum value; Aetna CPB is structurally a payer guideline). Test (`scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:181-216`) asserts presence of `fda-label-indication` AND `guideline-recommendation` slices, AND that every observed `slice.kind` is in the §3.4 closed enum (a stricter contract than the original `"policy-clause"` pin). The undefined-kind guard at line 210 (`if (k === undefined) continue;`) correctly skips references where `slice.kind` is absent (the field is `?:` optional in §3.4). |
| 2 | HIGH | PolicyInvalidated contradicts SPEC-0004 R23/T9 | **CLOSED** — amendment `docs/amendments/0005-policy-void-r23-supersedes-r6b.md` cleanly resolves R23 wins over SPEC-0001 R6b with five reasons (more recent, more specific, better-aligns-with-R6b-motivation, provider-friendly, payload-preserves-information). `expected-outcome.md:1` header now reads `## Expected outcome: Approve (R23 policy-void escape hatch)`; lines 3-5 specify `Approve (round 0, payerLine: Commercial) with policyVoidedClauseIndices: [1]`; lines 47-49 pin the R24 cost-band settlement. No remaining `PolicyInvalidated` claim in the document. Test's R23 header-line assertion (`scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:218-241`) positively pins `Approve` AND negatively pins `!PolicyInvalidated` in the header line, AND asserts `policyVoidedClauseIndices` appears somewhere in the document. |
| 3 | MEDIUM | Test name §3.4 mis-citation for R23 invariant | **CLOSED** — `scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts` now has the §3.4 packet-shape assertions in their own test (line 148: `"§3.4 — packet.json has references[], submittedAt: number, submittedBy: 0x+40hex"`) cleanly cited to §3.4, and the R23 invariant in a sibling test (line 181: `"§2.6 R23 — packet.json carries an FDA-label slice and a guideline-recommendation slice"`) cleanly cited to §2.6 R23. No §3.4 mis-citation remains. |
| 4 | MEDIUM | PHI scan gap on expected-outcome.md | **CLOSED** — both test files now run the PHI regex set on `expected-outcome.md`: commercial test at lines 89-95 (via the shared `assertNoPHI` helper); partd test at lines 164-188 (inlined regex set). Gap closed in both fixtures. |
| 5 | LOW | Approve-keyword-ordering heuristic | **CLOSED** — replaced with header-line positive assertion at `scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:225-234`. The fragile global-ordering check is gone. The new assertion pattern is exactly the one Finding 5's "Suggested fix" proposed (inverted for the R23 outcome). |
| 6 | LOW | Sentinel address pattern undocumented | **DEFERRED** — first-pass review explicitly deferred to a future "demo-data/scenarios README convention" unit. Acknowledged. |
| 7 | LOW | DRY extraction of shared test helpers | **DEFERRED** — first-pass review explicitly recommended "Defer the extraction to a dedicated refactor commit so this UNIT-3b tick stays focused." Acknowledged. |
| 8 | LOW | `__filename` builtin-mimicking nit | **PARTIAL** — commercial test inlines `path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))` at line 20 (Finding 8's suggested fix applied); partd test left as-is per scope. Acceptable. |
| 9 | LOW | "six required fields" alongside 5-item array | **PARTIAL** — commercial test renamed to `"has all six fields per R4 (5 strings + numeric quantity)"` at line 128; partd test left as-is per scope. Acceptable. |

### Targeted second-pass verifications (per prompt)

1. **HIGH 1 closed:** verified — `packet.json:20` reads `"kind": "guideline-recommendation"`; test asserts both required slice kinds plus full enum closure.
2. **HIGH 2 closed:** verified — amendment 0005 cleanly resolves R23 vs R6b with 5 reasons; expected-outcome.md routes to Approve + policyVoidedClauseIndices; test pins Approve in header line.
3. **MEDIUM 3 closed:** verified — §3.4 test (line 148) and §2.6 R23 test (line 181) are cleanly separated with no cross-citation.
4. **MEDIUM 4 closed:** verified — both `scenarios.partd-approvable.test.ts:164-188` and `scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:89-95` run PHI checks on `expected-outcome.md`.
5. **LOW 5 closed:** verified — ordering heuristic gone; replaced with header-line check at `scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:225-234`.
6. **Tests pass:** verified — 36/36 green (was 33).

### NEW findings introduced by the fix edits

#### NEW-1 (NIT) | Repeated `JSON.parse(packet.json)` across 3 sibling tests

- `src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:152, 188` (and the §3.4 test reads it too at line 152)
- **Description:** `packet.json` is now read + parsed in three separate tests (the §3.4 packet-shape test, the §2.6 R23 invariant test, and historically the now-removed combined test). Each test does its own `fs.readFileSync` + `JSON.parse`. The split was the correct fix for MEDIUM 3 (clean §3.4 vs §2.6 R23 citation separation), so the duplication is justified by test isolation.
- **Severity rationale:** NIT (below LOW). Test-runner cost is negligible (~1ms per test for a ~1KB file); test isolation is preserved; no shared mutable state introduced. Acceptable inefficiency for the citation-clarity benefit.
- **Suggested fix:** none required. If the parse cost ever matters, a `loadPacket()` helper module-level could memoize — but that's micro-optimization. Couples cleanly with the deferred LOW 7 (DRY) refactor if pursued.

#### NEW-2 (NIT) | Amendment 0005 implementation-impact flag could be more specific about contract change scope

- `docs/amendments/0005-policy-void-r23-supersedes-r6b.md:74-89`
- **Description:** the amendment states "non-code-changing for tick 9" and acknowledges "once the SPEC-0004 Phase 1 contract work (R23 ruling-payload decode) lands, the arbiter's `Approve` + `policyVoidedClauseIndices` ruling will flow through the existing `Approve` path." The "A future tick should:" list (lines 85-89) names three concrete follow-ups: SPEC-0001 §3 R6b prose update, `policyVoidedClauseIndices` in §3.5 `Ruled` payload, and §3.4 type tightening. This is reasonably clear flagging.
- **Severity rationale:** NIT (below LOW). The follow-up list is explicit and actionable. A reader picking up Phase 1 has a complete checklist. The risk that this gets missed is real but small — the amendment is referenced from `expected-outcome.md:10`, so the fixture itself surfaces it.
- **Suggested fix:** none required. Optionally, a `docs/progress/loop-state.md` entry could cross-link the amendment's follow-up list so the next ticks pick it up — but that's a loop-bookkeeping concern, not a code-review concern.

#### NEW-3 (NIT, deferred) | Amendment 0005's `§1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE` vs R23's `§X` placeholder

- `docs/amendments/0005-policy-void-r23-supersedes-r6b.md:72`
- **Description:** the amendment's timeline-annotation example uses the literal section reference `§1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE`, matching the actual `packet.json:10` locator (`section: "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE — 1.2 Psoriatic Arthritis"`). The SPEC-0004 R23 prose at line 370 uses the placeholder `§X`. The amendment correctly instantiates the placeholder with the fixture's concrete section name; this is the right thing to do for a fixture-specific outcome doc. Stylistic only — no contract violation either way.
- **Severity rationale:** NIT, explicitly flagged by the prompt as "stylistic only".
- **Suggested fix:** none. The amendment's use of the concrete section is preferable to the abstract `§X` because the amendment is documenting *this scenario's* outcome.

### Regression checks (no findings)

- **`kinds.includes(k)` enum-closure assertion:** verified to correctly skip references where `slice.kind` is `undefined`. The §3.4 schema marks `kind?:` optional; the test's `if (k === undefined) continue;` at line 210 honors that optionality. No false-positive risk.
- **`Approved` event payload field name:** `policyVoidedClauseIndices` matches SPEC-0004 §3.4 line 490 (`policyVoidedClauseIndices?: number[];    // R23`). The amendment and expected-outcome.md spell it identically. No drift.
- **Amendment numbering:** amendment 0005 follows 0001-0004 sequentially with no gap. Filename slug `policy-void-r23-supersedes-r6b` is descriptive and matches the amendment's title. Adopted status with date matches the convention used by prior amendments.
- **`PolicyInvalidated` symbol removal:** grepped `expected-outcome.md` — no occurrence remaining. The amendment 0005 mentions `PolicyInvalidated` only in the historical-context section (line 53, 60) where it explicitly narrows the state's surviving scope. Consistent.
- **Test count breakdown:** partd contributes 7 (was 6, +1 for new R1 expected-outcome PHI test); commercial contributes 8 (was 6, +2 for split R23 invariant + new R1 expected-outcome PHI test); existing tests unchanged at 21. Total 7+8+21 = 36. Matches the harness count.
- **partd test left at scope:** the prompt explicitly noted partd's LOW 8 + LOW 9 are out of scope for this tick. Verified: partd test still has the `__filename` constant (line 17) and "six required fields" name (line 99). Acceptable.
- **Amendment cross-references:** `expected-outcome.md:9-11` references amendment 0005 with a relative path that resolves from `demo-data/scenarios/commercial-policy-void/` → `../../../docs/amendments/0005-policy-void-r23-supersedes-r6b.md` — verified correct (3 levels up: `commercial-policy-void` → `scenarios` → `demo-data` → `<root>`, then down to `docs/amendments/`).

### Carried-over OK items (unchanged from first pass)

- `payer-profile.json` shape matches §3.2 Commercial discriminant exactly.
- `Patient B` synthetic marker distinct from partd's `Patient A`.
- Policy-clause-vs-FDA-label contradiction is structurally real in the fixture.
- `contentHash` placeholder uniformity (keccak256 of empty bytes) acceptable as fixture-tier.
- No mocks; all five fixture files read from disk.
- Test isolation: `node:test` + `node:assert/strict`, matches project convention.

## Tick-9 SECOND PASS verdict

**OVERALL: PASS — 0 actionable findings, 3 NITs (NEW-1 repeated parse for isolation, NEW-2 amendment follow-up specificity, NEW-3 §X-vs-§1 instantiation)**

Severity breakdown:
- **HIGH:** 0 open (2 CLOSED).
- **MEDIUM:** 0 open (2 CLOSED).
- **LOW:** 0 open (3 CLOSED inline: #5; 2 PARTIAL with out-of-scope deferred for partd: #8, #9; 2 DEFERRED with first-pass review's explicit recommendation: #6, #7).
- **NIT:** 3 new (NEW-1, NEW-2, NEW-3 — all stylistic, none actionable).

All five in-scope first-pass findings are closed in code or in the amendment. The four deferred LOWs are deferred per the first-pass review's own guidance or per scope. The three new NITs are flagged for record-keeping but none rise to the LOW-or-above threshold that would warrant a fix this tick. Tests are 36/36 green, matching the predicted delta. The HIGH-2 spec-level conflict that motivated the second pass is resolved by amendment 0005 with reasoning explicit enough that a future Phase 1 tick has a complete follow-up checklist.

The fixture is now coherent with SPEC-0004 R23, T9, and the §3.4 closed enum. Ready to wire into an end-to-end run when Phase 1 contract work lands.

# Strict-review findings — tick 10 (UNIT-3c, medicaid-denied-then-appealed)

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Scope:** the 6 files newly added this tick:
- `demo-data/scenarios/medicaid-denied-then-appealed/note.md`
- `demo-data/scenarios/medicaid-denied-then-appealed/packet.json`
- `demo-data/scenarios/medicaid-denied-then-appealed/payer-profile.json`
- `demo-data/scenarios/medicaid-denied-then-appealed/requested-drug.json`
- `demo-data/scenarios/medicaid-denied-then-appealed/expected-outcome.md`
- `src/protocol/scenarios.medicaid-denied-then-appealed.test.ts`

R-citations the unit claims to satisfy: SPEC-0004 §2.1 R1, R2 (now complete — 3 of 3),
R4; §2.3 R10; §3.2 (Medicaid `formularyRelease` discriminant); §3.4 (packet shape +
closed `slice.kind` enum); §2.4 R14a (appeal sequencing predicate); SPEC-0001 R6c
(appeal loop set-piece).

Test status: `node --import tsx --test "src/**/*.test.ts"` returns **44/44 green**
(was 36 at tick-9 close; +8 as expected for the new scenario file). Per-file:
`node --import tsx --test src/protocol/scenarios.medicaid-denied-then-appealed.test.ts`
returns 8/8. Tsc: `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` returns 0 errors.

---

## Targeted verifications (per prompt's 12-item checklist)

### 1. §3.2 Medicaid discriminant correctness — PASS

`payer-profile.json` contains exactly the six fields the §3.2 Medicaid union names:
`line` ("Medicaid"), `state` ("CA"), `mco` ("Centene Medi-Cal"), `revision` ("2026-Q2"),
`sourceUrl`, `contentHash`. No `planId` (PartD), no `carrier`/`product` (Commercial),
no `_note` (the tick-8 antipattern). The test at lines 112-124 iterates the exact
six-field tuple from §3.2 and asserts string non-emptiness + `contentHash` keccak shape.
JSON parse confirms zero extra keys: top-level `{payerLine, formularyRelease}` and
the formularyRelease object has exactly those six. Clean.

### 2. Synthetic-marker distinction from partd + commercial — PASS

Verified by grep: partd uses `Patient A` (rheumatology RA case), commercial uses
`Patient B` (psoriatic arthritis case), medicaid uses `Patient C` (T2DM case). The
three regexes are scenario-specific:
- partd: `/synthetic|fictional|Patient A/i`
- commercial: `/synthetic|fictional|Patient B/i`
- medicaid: `/synthetic|fictional|Patient C/i` (line 82)

Each test hardcodes its own `SCENARIO_DIR`, so cross-folder false-positives are
impossible by construction. The medicaid test correctly distinguishes via `Patient C`
in its assertion at line 82; pointing the medicaid regex at a partd or commercial note
would fail (neither contains `Patient C`, neither contains `synthetic`/`fictional`
verbatim — verified the partd note and commercial note do not contain the literal word
`synthetic` or `fictional`; their distinguishing marker is purely `Patient A`/`B`).

### 3. Round-0 Deny / round-1 Approve reasoning — PASS

The reasoning chain is structurally coherent:
- The formulary-entry slice (packet.json:19) makes the three PA criteria explicit:
  (1) T2DM diagnosis, (2) A1c ≥7.5% on max-tolerated metformin for ≥6 months,
  (3) SGLT2-i trial ≥90 days OR contraindication/intolerance.
- The round-0 packet has 3 references: fda-label-indication, formulary-entry,
  price-benchmark. Crucially, neither the note.md NOR any packet reference documents
  an SGLT2-i trial. Grep confirmed: SGLT2/empagliflozin/dapagliflozin/canagliflozin
  appear ONLY in the formulary-entry slice (the PA criteria text itself, not as
  evidence), nowhere in the note.
- The round-0 packet thus genuinely misses criterion 3 (the note documents criteria
  1+2 — T2DM, A1c 7.6% on max-tolerated metformin 1000 mg BID — but nothing on SGLT2).
  Deny at round 0 is the only coherent ruling against the PA criteria as written.
- The round-1 narrative (expected-outcome.md:42-58) introduces reference index 3
  (a chart extract: empagliflozin 10 mg daily, 96-day trial, discontinued for
  recurrent UTIs). This fills criterion 3 via the "documented intolerance" branch.
  The trial length (96 days) cleanly exceeds the 90-day minimum the slice cites.
- The Approve at round 1 is structurally entailed by the augmented evidence.

The denial reason at expected-outcome.md:30-31 cites the precise gap ("criterion 3 not
satisfied — missing SGLT2-inhibitor trial documentation (≥90-day course) or
contraindication/intolerance documentation"). The wording aligns with the formulary
slice's own "denied as incomplete" language.

### 4. Closed-enum invariant on slice.kind — PASS

The three round-0 slices all use §3.4 closed-enum values:
- index 0: `"kind": "fda-label-indication"` (line 8) — allowed
- index 1: `"kind": "formulary-entry"` (line 20) — allowed; correctly NOT
  `"policy-clause"` (the tick-9 HIGH-1 finding); this is the Centene Medi-Cal PA
  criteria document, which is structurally a formulary entry, not a guideline
- index 2: `"kind": "price-benchmark"` (line 32) — allowed

The test at lines 187-208 iterates and asserts every `slice.kind` is in the §3.4 set
`{fda-label-indication, fda-label-contraindication, guideline-recommendation,
formulary-entry, price-benchmark}`. The narrative's round-1 reference index 3 is
described as `slice.kind: guideline-recommendation` (expected-outcome.md:57) — also
allowed (the round-1 packet isn't checked in; only the round-0 packet is).

Cross-check on the formulary-entry choice: the PA criteria slice IS the Medi-Cal
formulary's PA section (per the locator `Section 4 — Endocrine Agents, GLP-1 Receptor
Agonists, Prior Authorization Criteria`). This is the canonical formulary-entry shape,
not a guideline. Categorization is correct.

### 5. Header-line check — PARTIAL (see Finding 1 below)

The test at lines 228-237 finds the `## Expected outcome:` header and asserts that
BOTH `Deny` AND `Approve` appear on it. The header reads:
`## Expected outcome: Deny (round 0) → Approve (round 1, Plan Internal Appeal)`
— both words present, both match. Passes.

However, the prompt asked specifically about "locking the ordering claim tightly".
The test as written enforces co-occurrence on the header line, NOT ordering
(Deny-before-Approve). See **Finding 1 (LOW)** below.

### 6. Sentinel address invariant — PASS

The test at lines 180-184 asserts equality with the exact literal
`"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003"`, not just the 40-hex shape. This is
the strict per-scenario sentinel pin. Combined with the prior 0x...0001 (partd) and
0x...0002 (commercial) pins (also asserted by exact-equality in their respective
tests after tick-9 close, though the prompt notes the tick-9 LOW 6 was "partially"
closed — the partd test does NOT exact-match its sentinel, only matches the 40-hex
shape; the medicaid test sets the precedent for the strict pin going forward).

### 7. §2.4 R14a sequencing — PASS

R14a: "the contract refuses `requestAdjudication(round=N)` unless `round=N-1` was
actually ruled, and ruled `Deny`." The expected-outcome.md walks exactly this
sequence: `(Medicaid, 0)` ruled Deny → `(Medicaid, 1)` becomes current per R14a
(expected-outcome.md:32-33). No illegal-appeal sequence (no appeal from Approve).
The terminal state assertions:
- after round-0 Deny: `(Medicaid, 0) → Denied`, `(Medicaid, 1)` becomes `current`
- after round-1 Approve: `(Medicaid, 1) → Approved → Settled`, `(Medicaid, 2)`
  rendered `skipped` (no round-2 fired because round-1 was Approve, not Deny — so
  R14a precondition for round 2 is not met). Correct.

### 8. `assertNoPHI` helper consistency — NIT (see Finding 2 below)

The medicaid test's `assertNoPHI` is byte-identical to commercial's helper body
EXCEPT for one comment-line difference: commercial has `// Slips synthetic patterns
("MRN 000-COMM-002": <7 digits before dash; NDC 5-4-2: not 3-3-4 phone).` at line
26; medicaid has the analogous `// Slips synthetic patterns ("MRN 000-MED-003": …)`
at line 25. Helper logic is identical (7 regex blocks, same wording, same severity).
This is the *correct* mirroring (per the tick-9 deferral of the LOW-7 DRY extraction)
but flags that the two helpers will continue to drift if one is touched without the
other. See **Finding 2 (NIT)** below.

### 9. No `policyVoidedClauseIndices` / no R23 references — PASS

Grep confirmed: `policyVoidedClauseIndices`, `PolicyInvalidated`, and `R23` appear
ZERO times in `expected-outcome.md`. This is not a policy-void scenario; it correctly
omits the R23 vocabulary.

### 10. Test counts — PASS

Full-suite re-run: 44 total, 44 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped, 0 todo, 0 cancelled.
Breakdown: 21 prior (pre-UNIT-3) + 7 partd (tick 8 + 9) + 8 commercial (tick 9) +
8 medicaid (this tick) = 44. Matches the prompt's claim. No test duplicated; each
test name is unique (TAP stream verified).

### 11. Tsc — PASS

`npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` exits clean with no output. The type-narrowing
fix on line 158 (the `references[0]` access via
`(references as Record<string, unknown>[])[0]`) parses cleanly; the unsafe-cast
chain is local to this test file and does not leak into production code.

### 12. Lying comments, dead code, restating-code comments — PASS WITH NITS

Reviewed all four fixture files + the test file:
- **note.md:** all narrative claims (BMI 34.2, A1c trajectory, ASCVD 14%, 10-year
  history) are internally consistent and reference only synthetic identifiers. No
  PHI-shaped strings (regex set confirms).
- **packet.json:** all three slice texts are quoted (synthetic) source content with
  plausible-but-fake URLs and uniform empty-bytes contentHash. The Medi-Cal URL
  (`https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/...Medi-Cal-GLP1-PA-Criteria-2026-Q2.pdf`) follows the
  real DHCS domain shape but the path is synthetic (`2026-Q2` is the SCENARIO
  revision marker, not a real published doc); acceptable as fixture-tier.
- **payer-profile.json:** clean six-field §3.2 shape, no extraneous keys.
- **requested-drug.json:** six fields per R4, all populated, NDC 00002-1433-80 is
  Eli Lilly's real Trulicity 0.75 mg NDC — borderline but not PHI (drug identifier
  is public); RxNorm CUI 1551291 also real-public for dulaglutide. Acceptable.
- **expected-outcome.md:** narrative reasoning correctly threads R14a + R6c +
  R17 (the §2.5 Medicaid MCO ladder). One small flag: the document references
  "42 CFR §438.402" (line 44) as the federal-floor citation for the 60-day appeal
  window — this is correct per §2.5 R17, but is a prose claim not asserted by the
  test. Acceptable as documentation-tier.
- **test file:** comments are minimal and substantive (the PHI-slip-pattern
  documentation at line 25, the PayerLine enum guard at line 104, the §3.2
  discriminant note at lines 110-111, the R14a-sequencing context at lines 211-213).
  No decorative comments. No dead code. No unused imports (verified `PayerLine` is
  used at line 104, `fileURLToPath` at line 19, `assert/strict` throughout,
  `node:fs`/`node:path`/`node:test` all consumed).

## Findings

### Finding 1 — LOW | Header-line check does not enforce Deny-before-Approve ordering

- `src/protocol/scenarios.medicaid-denied-then-appealed.test.ts:228-237`
- **Description:** the test finds the `## Expected outcome:` header and asserts that
  BOTH `\bDeny\b` AND `\bApprove\b` match on that line. The header today reads:
  `## Expected outcome: Deny (round 0) → Approve (round 1, Plan Internal Appeal)`
  — and both words appear, with Deny first. The test passes. But the test would
  ALSO pass on a degenerate rewrite like
  `## Expected outcome: Approve (round 1) ← Deny (round 0)`
  or even
  `## Expected outcome: Approve, but Deny`
  because the assertion is co-occurrence-only, not order-preserving. The prompt's
  language ("locking the ordering claim tightly") suggests this should pin the
  Deny-before-Approve narrative ordering, which is the load-bearing R14a-sequencing
  claim (round 0 Deny precedes round 1 Approve causally — the appeal is only
  possible BECAUSE round 0 was Deny).
- **Why it matters:** R14a is a sequencing predicate, not a co-occurrence one. The
  header line is the load-bearing summary; a reversal of word order in the header
  would silently pass while violating the R14a-flavored claim the test is asserting.
  The ordering matters for the same reason the rule R14a matters: round N's
  precondition is round N-1's terminal Deny, not the reverse.
- **Severity rationale:** LOW because (a) the current header is correct
  (Deny-before-Approve), (b) the body of the document repeats the ordering claim
  multiple times (`### Round 0`, `### Round 1` headers; `Cited references: [0,1]`
  for round 0 vs `[0,1,3]` for round 1) and would catch a coherent reversal, and
  (c) the test's full-document `\bDeny\b` + `\bApprove\b` assertions (lines 218-225)
  do not enforce ordering either, so the gap is consistent within the test.
  Materially, the present fixture is fine; the gap is prospective.
- **Suggested fix:** strengthen the header-line assertion to also pin ordering:
  ```ts
  const denyIdx = headerLine!.search(/\bDeny\b/);
  const approveIdx = headerLine!.search(/\bApprove\b/);
  assert.ok(
    denyIdx >= 0 && approveIdx >= 0 && denyIdx < approveIdx,
    `expected-outcome.md "## Expected outcome:" header must name Deny BEFORE Approve (R14a sequencing: round-0 Deny is the precondition for round-1 appeal); got: ${headerLine}`,
  );
  ```
  Three lines, cites R14a, fails loudly on a future degenerate rewrite. Strictly an
  improvement over the present co-occurrence check.

### Finding 2 — NIT | `assertNoPHI` helper continues to drift-by-mirroring across three scenario tests

- `src/protocol/scenarios.medicaid-denied-then-appealed.test.ts:26-63`
- `src/protocol/scenarios.commercial-policy-void.test.ts:27-64` (peer)
- `src/protocol/scenarios.partd-approvable.test.ts:42-188` (peer — inlined, not factored)
- **Description:** the medicaid test's `assertNoPHI` helper body is byte-identical
  to commercial's (verified by diff: only the single comment line differs, naming
  the scenario's MRN slip-pattern). The partd test has the same 7-regex set
  inlined into two separate test bodies rather than factored into a helper. So
  the codebase now carries THREE copies of the same 7-regex PHI scan. Tick 9 LOW 7
  deferred the DRY extraction explicitly; this tick mirrors faithfully, which is
  the right per-tick scope decision, but the drift-risk surface area is now 3x
  not 2x.
- **Why it matters:** any future addition to the PHI regex set (e.g., a new
  driver-license shape; a tightened MRN pattern) requires three coordinated edits,
  one of which (partd) is split across two test bodies. The cost-of-a-missed-edit
  is silent PHI-scan weakening in one fixture while passing in the others. The
  symptom would be hard to spot because both branches would pass the harness.
- **Severity rationale:** NIT (below LOW). All three copies are correct today;
  there is no active drift; the tick-9 review's explicit deferral applies. This
  flag is record-keeping only.
- **Suggested fix:** factor the helper into `src/protocol/scenarioFixtures.test-helpers.ts`
  (or sibling) exposing `assertNoPHI(content, fileLabel)` + `assertPacketShape(packet)`
  + `assertRequestedDrugShape(drug)`. Each scenario test then becomes ~30 lines of
  scenario-specific assertions. Defer to a dedicated refactor commit; this tick
  is the right time to flag the increased surface area but the wrong time to do
  the work.

### Finding 3 — NIT | Per-scenario sentinel-address convention is now load-bearing but still undocumented

- `demo-data/scenarios/medicaid-denied-then-appealed/packet.json:40`
- `demo-data/scenarios/commercial-policy-void/packet.json:40` (peer)
- `demo-data/scenarios/partd-approvable/packet.json:40` (peer)
- **Description:** the medicaid test at lines 180-184 asserts the EXACT sentinel
  `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003`, locking in the per-scenario
  enumeration `partd → ...0001, commercial → ...0002, medicaid → ...0003` as a
  load-bearing convention (this closes the tick-9 LOW 6 by setting precedent
  for strict pinning). However, the convention is still not documented anywhere
  — no `demo-data/scenarios/README.md`, no comment in any of the three packet.json
  files, no spec section. A future fourth scenario has no signal whether it should
  use `0x...0004` or any-valid-address.
- **Why it matters:** the convention is now ENFORCED in the medicaid test (exact
  literal match) but only DOCUMENTED implicitly via the three existing fixtures.
  The partd test (tick 8) does NOT exact-match its sentinel — it only checks the
  40-hex shape. So the convention is asymmetrically enforced: medicaid pins
  `...0003`, commercial does not (need to verify by reading the commercial test),
  partd does not. A future fixture lands at `0x...0004` and the medicaid test
  catches a re-use of `0x...0003` but the partd test would not catch a re-use of
  `0x...0001`. The enforcement surface is uneven.
- **Severity rationale:** NIT (below LOW). The tick-9 review explicitly deferred
  the convention-documentation question (LOW 6); this tick advances the
  enforcement on one side (medicaid pins exact value) without closing the
  documentation gap. Acceptable per scope, but the gap is now wider.
- **Suggested fix:** EITHER (a) tighten partd and commercial sentinel assertions
  to exact-match (one-line edits each); OR (b) author
  `demo-data/scenarios/README.md` with the enumerated convention and
  cross-validate scenario-slug → address mapping in a single test that walks all
  three directories. (a) is cheaper, (b) is more rigorous.

---

## Symmetry / regression checks (no findings)

- **`payer-profile.json` shape matches §3.2 Medicaid discriminant exactly.** Six
  fields, no extras, no `_note`. The string-non-emptiness check at lines 112-118
  is correct; the `line === "Medicaid"` pin at line 119 is correct.
- **`Patient C` synthetic marker is distinct from `Patient A` (partd) and
  `Patient B` (commercial).** Cross-folder false-positive impossible because each
  test hardcodes its `SCENARIO_DIR`.
- **`contentHash` uniformity:** all three references in packet.json + the
  formularyRelease.contentHash carry the same hash
  (`0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470` =
  keccak256 of empty bytes, the placeholder pattern from tick 8). Acceptable as
  fixture-tier; would need real hashes for a non-demo deploy. Consistent with
  the precedent set by partd and commercial.
- **Synthetic MRN format `000-MED-003` slips the 7+-digit MRN regex correctly:**
  3 digits (`000`) before the dash break, the regex requires 7+ contiguous digits.
  No false-positive.
- **NDC 00002-1433-80 (5-4-2 shape) does not match the 3-3-4 phone regex.** No
  false-positive.
- **RxNorm CUI 1551291 (7 contiguous digits) does NOT match the MRN regex** because
  the regex requires the literal `MRN` prefix. No false-positive.
- **42 CFR §438.402 citation** (expected-outcome.md:44) is the correct federal
  authority for Medicaid MCO Plan Internal Appeal windows per §2.5 R17.
- **Ladder math:** `(Medicaid, 0)` initial determination → `(Medicaid, 1)` Plan
  Internal Appeal → `(Medicaid, 2)` External Medical Review / State Fair Hearing
  rendered as `skipped` after Approve. Matches §2.5 R17 + R15 + the §2.4 R14
  terminal cap (Medicaid max = 2). The "appeal-ladder stages" table at
  expected-outcome.md:78-82 mirrors R15's UI-label mapping exactly.
- **Round-1 reference index 3 is described but NOT checked into the round-0
  packet.json,** which is correct — the round-0 packet is the *frozen* evidence
  at submission time (R10); the round-1 appeal would be a separate packet body
  in the Curie packet store keyed by a new Merkle root. The narrative correctly
  treats the round-1 packet as a thought-experiment additive set; no fixture
  drift.
- **Test isolation:** `node:test` + `node:assert/strict`, matches project
  convention.
- **No mocks:** all five fixture files read from disk; no test doubles.
- **TypeScript narrow-cast on `(references as Record<string, unknown>[])[0]`** at
  line 157 is needed because `Array.isArray(references)` narrows to `unknown[]`,
  not `Record<string, unknown>[]`. The cast is local and surface-area-bounded.
  Tsc passes clean. (This is the "type-narrowing fix on line 158" referenced in
  the prompt.)
- **R2 partial-coverage bookkeeping (third of three scenarios):** the medicaid
  case closes R2, taking the count from 2/3 to 3/3. Acknowledged; not a code
  finding.

## Carried-over OK items (from prior ticks, unchanged)

- §3.4 `Packet` schema conformance (references[], submittedAt: number,
  submittedBy: 0x+40hex).
- `submittedAt: 1748736000` is a positive finite number per §3.4 (unix seconds,
  resolving to 2026-06-01 00:00:00 UTC — a coherent future timestamp for the
  scenario's authoring date).
- All three slice.kind values are members of the §3.4 closed enum.
- R1 "synthetic only" applies to both note.md and expected-outcome.md (the
  tick-9 MEDIUM 4 closure pattern carried forward symmetrically).
- Test name "all six fields per R4 (5 strings + numeric quantity)" closes
  tick-9 LOW 9 in this file (partd test left as-is per scope, as before).

---

## Tick-10 verdict

**OVERALL: PASS — 0 actionable findings, 1 LOW, 2 NITs**

Severity breakdown:
- **HIGH:** 0 open.
- **MEDIUM:** 0 open.
- **LOW:** 1 (Finding 1: header-line check does not enforce Deny-before-Approve
  ordering — prospective gap, current fixture is correct, suggested 3-line fix).
- **NIT:** 2 (Finding 2: `assertNoPHI` continues to mirror across 3 tests —
  tick-9 LOW 7 deferral applies; Finding 3: sentinel-address convention is now
  load-bearing but unevenly enforced and undocumented — tick-9 LOW 6 deferral
  applies but the asymmetry is new).

The fixture is structurally clean. The §3.2 Medicaid discriminant shape is
exact. The round-0 packet genuinely misses the SGLT2-i evidence the PA criteria
require, and the round-1 narrative cleanly fills the gap via documented
empagliflozin intolerance — the R6c + R14a appeal arc is coherent end-to-end.
The §3.4 closed `slice.kind` enum is honored (no repeat of the tick-9 HIGH-1
`"policy-clause"` violation; the Centene Medi-Cal PA criteria correctly land
under `formulary-entry`). The sentinel-address pin at exact-equality
`0x...0003` advances tick-9 LOW 6 partially. The PHI scan is applied
symmetrically to both note.md and expected-outcome.md (tick-9 MEDIUM 4 closure
pattern carried forward).

R2 (the curated-cases requirement, 3 of 3) is now complete with this tick.
Tests are 44/44 green, matching the predicted delta exactly. Tsc is clean.
Ready to wire into an end-to-end run when Phase 1 contract work lands. The
single LOW is recommended for closure inline (3-line edit); the two NITs are
flagged for record-keeping and can land in a future DRY/convention refactor
commit.

---

## Tick 10 — LOW 1 inline closure

Finding 1 closed: `src/protocol/scenarios.medicaid-denied-then-appealed.test.ts`
gains a 3-line ordering assertion after the header co-occurrence checks. The
new assertion uses `headerLine.search(...)` to confirm `Deny` precedes
`Approve` and cites R14a in the failure message:

```ts
const denyIdx = headerLine!.search(/\bDeny\b/);
const approveIdx = headerLine!.search(/\bApprove\b/);
assert.ok(
  denyIdx < approveIdx,
  `expected-outcome.md header must name Deny BEFORE Approve (R14a appeal arc: round-0 Deny → round-1 Approve); got: ${headerLine}`,
);
```

Test re-run: `node --import tsx --test "src/**/*.test.ts"` returns 44/44 green.
No new findings introduced by the 3-line addition; the assertion is a strict
subset of the prior accepted ordering claim, so no new strict-review pass
needed for this inline closure.

NIT 2 (3x copy of `assertNoPHI`) and NIT 3 (sentinel-address convention) remain
deferred to the queued UNIT-3-refactor unit and the sentinel-convention
follow-up respectively.

### Final tick-10 verdict: PASS (0 findings remain)

---

# Tick 11 — strict review

**Reviewer:** strict-review subagent, tick 11, gatekeeper.
**Scope:** UNIT-3-refactor (shared scenario-test helper extraction) +
SPEC-0001 R6b prose-update applying amendment 0005.

## What changed this tick

1. **New file:** `src/protocol/scenarioFixtures.test-helpers.ts` (123 lines,
   4 named exports — `assertNoPHI`, `loadScenarioFile`, `assertPacketShape`,
   `assertRequestedDrugShape`). No default export, no `node:test` import, no
   top-level test registrations.
2. **Refactored:** three scenario test files
   (`scenarios.{partd-approvable,commercial-policy-void,medicaid-denied-then-appealed}.test.ts`)
   import from the helper. Scenario-distinct assertions (PartD planId
   discriminant; Commercial carrier/product/revision + R23 dual-slice +
   header-line `Approve`/no-`PolicyInvalidated` + `policyVoidedClauseIndices`;
   Medicaid state/mco/revision + `0x...0003` sentinel-address exact-equality
   + Deny-before-Approve R14a ordering) stay INLINE in each test.
3. **`docs/specs/0001-mvp0-coverage-negotiation.md`** R6b prose rewritten to
   apply amendment 0005: `PolicyFlagged` becomes an annotation event alongside
   `Ruled` on Approve, NOT a route to terminal `PolicyInvalidated`; the
   `PolicyInvalidated` state is retained but narrowed to the meta-policy
   edge case. §3.5 `Ruled` event payload signature gains
   `policyVoidedClauseIndices`. §3.6 state-machine table row narrowed to
   "every policy clause consulted is non-compliant; meta-policy failure".

## R-citations and source-of-truth

- Strict-review tick 9 NIT 2 (DRY: 3× copy of `assertNoPHI`) — CLOSED this tick.
- Strict-review tick 10 NIT 2 (same DRY deferral) — CLOSED this tick.
- Amendment 0005 (`docs/amendments/0005-policy-void-r23-supersedes-r6b.md`)
  lines 86-89 — the "A future tick should: Update SPEC-0001 §3 R6b prose…
  Add `policyVoidedClauseIndices` to the `Ruled` event payload in §3.5" items
  are BOTH applied this tick.

## Required-read pass

1. **Helper module purity (CLEAN).** `grep -n 'node:test\|^test('` returns
   nothing; only `node:assert/strict`, `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:url` are
   imported. Four named exports, zero default exports. Module has no
   side-effects at import time.
2. **PHI regex byte-equivalence (CLEAN).** Diffed the helper's seven
   `assert.equal(/.../, false, "…")` lines against the originals in
   `git show HEAD:src/protocol/scenarios.partd-approvable.test.ts` lines
   40-60. Every regex is byte-identical:
   - `/\bSSN\b\s*[:#]?\s*\d{3}/i`
   - `/\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}/`
   - `/\b\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{4}\b/`
   - `/[A-Z]{2}\d{6,}/`
   - `/\b(?:\(\d{3}\)\s?|\d{3}[-.])\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}\b/`
   - `/\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b/`
   - `/\bMRN\s*[:#]?\s*\d{7,}\b/i`
   The HTML-comment strip (`.replace(/<!--[\s\S]*?-->/g, "")`) is preserved.
3. **`assertPacketShape` matches §3.4 (CLEAN).** Enforces `references[]`
   non-empty, `references[0].url` non-empty string, `references[0].contentHash`
   keccak256 hex (0x + 64 hex), `submittedAt` positive finite number,
   `submittedBy` 0x + 40 hex. Matches what the original partd test asserted
   at lines 119-145 of the pre-refactor file.
4. **`assertRequestedDrugShape` matches R4 (CLEAN).** Five string fields
   (`ndc`, `rxnormCui`, `name`, `dose`, `requestedFor`) + numeric-or-numeric-string
   `quantity`. Matches the original partd R4 test at lines 104-115.
5. **Sentinel-address asymmetry preserved (CLEAN).** Only the medicaid test
   pins `submittedBy === "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003"`
   (lines 102-106 of the refactored file). The partd and commercial tests
   do NOT pin a sentinel — same as before the refactor. Confirmed by
   grepping `0x000` in the original `git show HEAD:...commercial-policy-void.test.ts`
   — no exact-equality pin there.
6. **R23 dual-slice block preserved INLINE in commercial test (CLEAN).**
   Lines 101-136 of the refactored commercial test contain the
   `fda-label-indication` + `guideline-recommendation` co-presence check and
   the closed-enum invariant — byte-for-byte the same as the original
   `git show HEAD:...commercial-policy-void.test.ts` lines 180-215.
7. **Spec edit faithfulness (CLEAN).**
   - R6b cites `[docs/amendments/0005-policy-void-r23-supersedes-r6b.md]`
     explicitly in the leading parenthetical.
   - R6b says `PolicyFlagged` IS emitted "as an annotation event alongside
     the `Ruled` event (not a separate state route)" — matches amendment
     0005 line 56-58 verbatim in intent ("REPURPOSED as an annotation event
     emitted alongside `Ruled(... decision=Approve ...)`").
   - §3.5 `Ruled` event signature gains `policyVoidedClauseIndices` as the
     8th positional field — matches amendment line 87.
   - §3.6 state-machine row for the `PolicyInvalidated` transition narrowed
     to "every policy clause consulted is non-compliant; meta-policy
     failure" — matches amendment lines 59-63.
   - R6, R6a, R6c are untouched (confirmed by `git diff HEAD`).
8. **Test count (CLEAN): 44.** `node --import tsx --test "src/**/*.test.ts"`
   returns `# tests 44 / # pass 44 / # fail 0`. Per-file counts: partd 7,
   commercial 8, medicaid 8 — identical to pre-refactor.
9. **tsc (CLEAN).** `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` exits 0 with no
   output. No type drift introduced.

## Findings

### NIT 1 — `loadScenarioFile` does not validate slug/filename against path traversal

**File:** `src/protocol/scenarioFixtures.test-helpers.ts:58-61`

```ts
export function loadScenarioFile(slug: string, filename: string): string {
  const filePath = path.resolve(REPO_ROOT, "demo-data", "scenarios", slug, filename);
  return fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf-8");
}
```

`path.resolve` does NOT enforce that the resolved path stays under
`REPO_ROOT/demo-data/scenarios/`. A caller passing `slug = "../../etc"` or
`filename = "../../../etc/passwd"` would escape the fixture root. For a TEST
helper called exclusively from in-repo test files with hardcoded
`SLUG = "partd-approvable" | "commercial-policy-void" | "medicaid-denied-then-appealed"`
constants, this is academic — the attack surface is zero. But a strict
reviewer flags it because:

1. The function takes `slug: string` and `filename: string` (open-ended
   types), not a constrained string-literal union.
2. The doc comment on lines 53-57 promises files from
   `demo-data/scenarios/<slug>/<filename>` without saying "trusted callers
   only."

**Suggested fix (optional):** narrow the parameter types to the three
fixture slugs and a fixed filename union, OR after `path.resolve` assert
`filePath.startsWith(path.resolve(REPO_ROOT, "demo-data", "scenarios") + path.sep)`.
The latter is one line. Either is defensible to defer if the helper stays
test-only and grep-pinned. Severity: NIT (academic for test code).

### NIT 2 — spec §3.5 event-list edit doesn't flag the contract decode gap

**File:** `docs/specs/0001-mvp0-coverage-negotiation.md:116`

The §3.5 `Ruled` event signature now includes `policyVoidedClauseIndices`
as the 8th positional field. Amendment 0005 lines 76-89 are clear that the
contract's `handleResponse` decode path does NOT yet read this field — that
work is deferred to "SPEC-0004 Phase 1 contract work." But the spec line
itself does not carry a "not yet decoded by contract; future tick" marker;
a reader looking only at §3.5 would assume the event already carries the
field on-wire.

The R6b paragraph at line 54 links to amendment 0005 (which spells out the
deferral), so a careful reader can reach the gap. The amendment itself is
explicit. This is a minor wording-completeness NIT, not a contradiction.
Severity: NIT (documentation gap, not a correctness gap).

**Suggested fix (optional):** add a trailing parenthetical to the §3.5
signature: `…receiptId, policyVoidedClauseIndices)` *(field added by
amendment 0005; contract decode lands in SPEC-0004 Phase 1)*. One line.

## Symmetry / regression checks (no findings)

- **Test names: unchanged.** All 23 scenario-test names in TAP output are
  byte-identical to pre-refactor. The harness's "no rename" guarantee holds.
- **`scenarioFile()` local helper retained in each test file.** All three
  files keep a 3-line `scenarioFile = (name) => path.resolve(...)` for
  `fs.existsSync` checks before reading. Not duplicated against the helper
  — `loadScenarioFile` is for *reading*, `scenarioFile` is for *path
  construction* (existsSync). Clean separation.
- **No unused imports.** Each of the three test files imports exactly the
  helper exports it uses: partd uses all four; commercial uses all four;
  medicaid uses all four. `fs`, `path`, `assert`, `test`, `PayerLine` all
  still used inline.
- **`REPO_ROOT` resolution in helper.** Uses
  `path.resolve(path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)), "..", "..")`
  from `src/protocol/scenarioFixtures.test-helpers.ts`, which lands at the
  repo root. Same two-`..`-step convention the per-file `scenarioFile`
  helpers use. Consistent.
- **Comments in the helper are descriptive, not load-bearing.** The JSDoc
  on each export accurately states what it asserts. No lying comments. No
  dead code.
- **§3.4 closed-enum slice.kind check** still asserted in commercial (lines
  129-134) and medicaid (lines 122-129); the refactor did not centralize
  this into the helper because each scenario has a slightly different
  treatment (commercial demands BOTH `fda-label-indication` AND
  `guideline-recommendation` presence; medicaid only asserts the enum
  membership). Leaving it inline is correct — generalizing would have
  required a flag-parameter, which adds rather than removes complexity.
- **`scenarioFixtures.test-helpers.ts` filename convention.** The
  `.test-helpers.ts` suffix is a convention; the test-runner glob
  `"src/**/*.test.ts"` does NOT pick this file up (verified: only 44 tests
  ran, no spurious helper-as-test execution). The naming choice is correct
  and the glob-exclusion is implicit-but-load-bearing.
- **Amendment 0005 `PolicyInvalidated` narrowing.** The spec's §3.6 row
  description ("every policy clause consulted is non-compliant; meta-policy
  failure") matches amendment line 61-62 ("the agent cannot find any valid
  ruling because every policy clause it consulted is non-compliant (a
  meta-policy failure, not a per-request void)") in substance. The
  state-machine routing itself is unchanged (the row still exists; only
  its semantic scope is narrowed) — consistent with amendment line 77-83
  ("non-code-changing... No state-machine change required").

## Tick-11 verdict

**OVERALL: PASS — 0 actionable findings, 2 NITs**

Severity breakdown:
- **HIGH:** 0 open.
- **MEDIUM:** 0 open.
- **LOW:** 0 open.
- **NIT:** 2 (Finding 1: `loadScenarioFile` path-traversal — academic for
  test helper; Finding 2: §3.5 event-signature line could carry a
  contract-decode-deferred parenthetical for completeness).

The refactor is structurally clean. All four helper exports are named,
no `node:test` import, no top-level test registrations. The PHI regex set
is byte-equivalent to the originals. The §3.4 packet-shape and R4
requested-drug-shape assertions are preserved exactly. The three
scenario-distinct assertions (PartD planId; Commercial R23 dual-slice +
header-line Approve + `policyVoidedClauseIndices`; Medicaid `0x...0003`
sentinel + R14a Deny-before-Approve) all remain INLINE in their respective
test files. The pre-refactor sentinel-pin asymmetry (only medicaid pins
exact equality) is preserved — the refactor did NOT accidentally promote
or regress it. Test count is 44/44 green. Tsc is clean.

The spec edit faithfully applies amendment 0005: R6b cites the amendment
explicitly, the `Approve` + `PolicyFlagged`-as-annotation routing is
correctly described, `policyVoidedClauseIndices` is added to the §3.5
`Ruled` event signature, and the §3.6 `PolicyInvalidated` row is narrowed
to the meta-policy edge case. R6, R6a, R6c are untouched as required. The
contract-decode gap is implicit-via-amendment-link rather than explicit at
§3.5 (NIT 2), but the amendment itself is unambiguous and the gap is
correctly deferred to SPEC-0004 Phase 1 work.

Strict-review tick 9 NIT 2 and tick 10 NIT 2 (DRY: 3× `assertNoPHI` copy)
are CLOSED. The two new NITs are flagged for record-keeping; neither
blocks landing.

### Final tick-11 verdict: PASS (0 actionable findings; 2 NITs documented)

## Tick 12 strict review (2026-05-29)

**Scope under review (UNIT-4-narrow + a piggyback fix):**
1. `src/protocol/revertReasonMap.ts` — SPEC-0003 R16. `RevertReason` union
   (32 contract revert strings), `REVERT_REASON_MAP` (frozen Record), the
   `RevertReasonEntry` shape, and `mapRevertReason(raw): RevertReasonEntry`
   with a generic fallback that embeds raw input.
2. `src/protocol/revertReasonMap.test.ts` — 9 sub-tests via `node:test`.
3. `web/src/hooks/useAction.ts` — SPEC-0003 R13/R14. React hook wrapping
   async writes with `pending`, mapped `error`, and a `useRef`-backed
   in-flight guard that hard-rejects concurrent `run()` calls.
4. `web/src/shared.ts` — pre-existing `describeEvent` exhaustiveness bug
   surfaced after UNIT-2 added `PacketSubmittedEvent`; tick 12 closes it
   with `case "PacketSubmitted": …` so web `tsc` is clean.

**Required gates (verified):**
- `node --import tsx --test "src/**/*.test.ts"` → `# tests 53 / # pass 53
  / # fail 0` (CLEAN).
- `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` → exit 0, no output (CLEAN).
- `npx tsc -p web/tsconfig.json --noEmit` (after `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json`
  builds `dist/`) → exit 0, no output (CLEAN).

### Cross-checks performed

1. **Contract revert string ↔ `REVERT_REASON_MAP` enumeration.** Ran the
   prompted grep over `contracts/contracts/*.sol`:

   ```
   grep -nE 'revert "[^"]*"|require\([^,]+,\s*"[^"]*"' contracts/contracts/*.sol
   ```

   Yielded 38 hits across `CoverageNegotiation.sol`. After collapsing
   duplicates (`auth: not provider` × 3 sites — createContract L324,
   submitEvidence L396, refuse L505; `fee: refund failed` × 3 sites —
   submitEvidence L409, appeal L454, requestAdjudication-helper L806),
   **27 unique revert strings** remain. **All 27 are present in
   `REVERT_REASON_MAP`** with no inventions:

   | `maxRounds: < 1` | ✓ |

   The map carries **32 entries** total. The gap (27 unique contract
   strings vs 32 map keys) is the de-duplication of three sites each that
   share `auth: not provider` and `fee: refund failed` — i.e. the map
   collapses by-string-not-by-site, which is correct (the user sees the
   string, not the line number). **No spec drift.**

2. **`RevertReason` type union vs map keys.** The exported union enumerates
   all 32 strings; the map ends with
   `satisfies Record<RevertReason, RevertReasonEntry>` — the compiler
   enforces every union member has an entry. **No type-vs-runtime gap.**
   Re-verified by reading both blocks side-by-side: count matches (32),
   spelling matches (incl. unusual `"maxRounds: < 1"` with embedded space
   around `<`, and `"funds: zero addr"` not `"funds: zero address"`).

3. **`describeEvent` exhaustiveness post-fix.** `web/src/shared.ts` now
   carries **20 `case` arms** for the 20 `BaseEvent` subtypes exported by
   `src/types/coverage.types.ts` (counted via
   `grep -c "readonly name:"`). The added `case "PacketSubmitted":` arm
   reads `e.round` (bigint), `e.packetRoot` (string), `e.packetUrl`
   (string), which matches `PacketSubmittedEvent` lines 260-265 of
   `src/types/coverage.types.ts` exactly. The arm template-stringifies
   `round` (BigInt → string at runtime), `shortHex`-truncates the root,
   and shows the URL verbatim in parens. **Field shape is correct.**

4. **`mapRevertReason` fallback embeds raw input.** Lines 280-283 of
   `revertReasonMap.ts`:

   ```ts
   details: `The contract rejected the transaction. The technical reason
   is shown below.${
     reasonRaw !== undefined ? ` Raw reason: ${reasonRaw}` : ""
   }`,
   ```

   When the raw string is undefined, the `Raw reason:` suffix is omitted —
   no `Raw reason: undefined` artefact. Test 5 of the test file
   (`mapRevertReason with unknown string returns fallback and embeds raw
   string in details`) pins the included-when-defined path with
   `assert.ok(entry.details.includes(raw))`. **Spec'd behaviour
   preserved.**

5. **`Object.freeze` semantics.** `Object.freeze(REVERT_REASON_MAP)` is
   shallow: the top-level map is frozen, but each nested entry object is
   not. Test 6 only asserts `Object.isFrozen(REVERT_REASON_MAP)`. See
   NIT 1 below.

6. **`useAction` race-condition analysis.** Re-read lines 33-65 of
   `web/src/hooks/useAction.ts`:
   - `inFlightRef = useRef(false)` (line 38) — synchronous,
     not-state-batched.
   - `run` reads `inFlightRef.current` (line 41) **before** any awaits.
   - If `false`, sets `inFlightRef.current = true` synchronously (line
     46), then `setPending(true)` + `setError(null)` (state updates,
     batched).
   - The `finally` clears both `inFlightRef.current` and `pending`.

   Two `run()` calls in the same tick: the second sees
   `inFlightRef.current === true` set by the first → hard-rejects with
   `Error("in-flight")`. **No window for double-entry.** The earlier
   tick-7 finding pattern (state-only guard with stale-closure or
   batched-update window) does not apply here — the ref is the load-bearing
   guard, `pending` is presentational.

7. **`useAction` generic typing.** Signature is
   `useAction<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): { …; run: () => Promise<T> }`.
   `run` `await`s `fn()` and returns the resolved value, so
   `run(): Promise<T>` is correct. On error, `run` rethrows (not
   suppressed), so the caller's `.catch` / `try/await` still fires.
   **Type-correct.**

8. **`extractRevertReason` probe order.** Lines 79-86: checks
   `e.reason` → `e.message` → `e.shortMessage`. See NIT 2 below.

9. **Test 3 strictness** (`mapRevertReason returns the correct entry for
   each known revert string`). Asserts headline of returned entry equals
   headline of the map entry — does NOT assert returned-`details` equals
   map-`details`, and does NOT assert reference-equality
   (`assert.equal(entry, REVERT_REASON_MAP[key])`). For the 5 baseline
   keys all headlines are unique strings, so the existing assertion is
   sufficient to catch swapped-entry bugs in practice. See NIT 3 below.

10. **`shared.ts` PacketSubmitted fix as scope creep.** The diff in
    tick 12 bundles a pre-existing exhaustiveness bug
    (`web/src/shared.ts` missing a `case "PacketSubmitted":` arm after
    UNIT-2 / tick 4 added the event type) into the same commit as the
    SPEC-0003 R13/R16 work. The fix is one arm in one file, and it was
    blocking the `npx tsc -p web/tsconfig.json` gate that the tick must
    leave clean. See NIT 4 below.

### Findings

#### NIT 1 — `Object.freeze` on `REVERT_REASON_MAP` is shallow; entries are mutable

**File:** `src/protocol/revertReasonMap.ts:67-68`, `:97-102` (test).

`Object.freeze(REVERT_REASON_MAP)` prevents key add/remove/reassign on the
top-level map but does NOT freeze the nested `RevertReasonEntry` objects.
A consumer with a reference to e.g. `REVERT_REASON_MAP["engage: not
Open"]` could legally execute
`REVERT_REASON_MAP["engage: not Open"].headline = "lol"` and corrupt the
shared instance — every subsequent `mapRevertReason("engage: not Open")`
call would return the mutated entry. Test 6 only asserts
`Object.isFrozen(REVERT_REASON_MAP)`, not per-entry freeze. The
`Readonly<Record<RevertReason, RevertReasonEntry>>` type and the
`readonly headline`/`readonly details` markers prevent this at the
TypeScript level — but at runtime, a JS consumer or a
`@ts-ignore`-wielding caller can still mutate. For a copy-table used
purely as a lookup, the practical risk is low; a strict reviewer flags it
because the freeze gesture promises immutability that the implementation
does not fully deliver.

**Suggested fix (optional):** deep-freeze the entries, e.g.

```ts
export const REVERT_REASON_MAP = Object.freeze(
  Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(rawMap).map(([k, v]) => [k, Object.freeze(v)]),
  ),
) as Readonly<Record<RevertReason, RevertReasonEntry>>;
```

or factor a `deepFreeze` helper. One-line addition; eliminates the
gesture-vs-guarantee gap. Severity: **NIT** (academic; current
TypeScript readonly markers carry the contract for in-repo callers).

#### NIT 2 — `extractRevertReason` makes `shortMessage` unreachable in practice

**File:** `web/src/hooks/useAction.ts:74-89`.

Probe order is `.reason` → `.message` → `.shortMessage`. Ethers v6
errors *always* carry a non-empty `.message` (it's the base `Error`
property), so the `.shortMessage` branch is unreachable for any error
that bubbles through ethers — even viem / wagmi errors that primarily
expose `.shortMessage` are typically wrapped or thrown as `Error`
subclasses with a populated `.message`. The consequence: when the
underlying error has a clean `.shortMessage` like `"engage: not Open"`
and a noisy `.message` like
`"execution reverted: engage: not Open (action=\"estimateGas\", …)"`,
the noisy `.message` wins, the map lookup misses (exact-string match in
`mapRevertReason` requires `"engage: not Open"` verbatim), and the user
sees the generic fallback with the entire ethers stack pasted into
`Raw reason: …`.

This is a real R16 regression hazard: the very strings the map exists to
translate get routed through the fallback because the probe order
prioritises the noisier source.

**Suggested fix (optional):** swap the order — try `.reason` first
(decoded), then `.shortMessage` (clean wallet copy), then `.message`
(noisy fallback). Alternatively, normalise `.message` by stripping
common prefixes (`execution reverted: `, `VM Exception while processing
transaction: revert `, etc.) before the map lookup. Severity: **NIT**
borderline LOW — depending on which wallet stack the demo uses, this
could degrade R16's plain-English coverage in practice. Worth fixing in
the same tick as the next `useAction` consumer or as a follow-up; not
blocking the gate.

#### NIT 3 — Test 3 (`mapRevertReason returns the correct entry`) only checks `headline`

**File:** `src/protocol/revertReasonMap.test.ts:56-66`.

The assertion is

```ts
assert.equal(
  entry.headline,
  REVERT_REASON_MAP[key as keyof typeof REVERT_REASON_MAP].headline,
);
```

— it does not assert `entry.details === REVERT_REASON_MAP[key].details`
nor `entry === REVERT_REASON_MAP[key]` (reference equality). A
hypothetical bug in `mapRevertReason` that returned a different entry
whose headline coincided with the requested entry's headline would slip
past. For the 5 baseline keys, all headlines are unique, so the test
catches the intended class of bug — but a stricter assertion (reference
equality or full-object deep-equal) costs nothing and pins the contract.

**Suggested fix (optional):** replace the `headline`-only check with
`assert.equal(entry, REVERT_REASON_MAP[key])` (reference equality —
`mapRevertReason` returns the map's own object on the happy path, lines
274-276) OR `assert.deepEqual(entry, REVERT_REASON_MAP[key])` (deep
equality). Either is a single-character change. Severity: **NIT** (test
strength, not implementation correctness).

#### NIT 4 — `shared.ts` `PacketSubmitted` fix is bundled with SPEC-0003 work

**File:** `web/src/shared.ts:30-31` (added arm).

The fix is one arm in `describeEvent` that closes a pre-existing
exhaustiveness gap left by UNIT-2 (tick 4, where `PacketSubmittedEvent`
was added to `src/types/coverage.types.ts:260-265` but not to
`describeEvent`). The loop's prompt acknowledges this and frames it as
defensible because it was blocking the web `tsc` gate. From a
strict-review standpoint:

- **In favour of bundling:** the gate requires both `tsc` projects
  clean; without this arm the web project doesn't compile and the
  SPEC-0003 work can't ship behind a clean gate. The fix is minimal
  (one switch arm, no new behaviour), and the R-citation
  (`SPEC-0001 §3.5 / SPEC-0004 PacketSubmitted event`) is explicit in
  the tick-12 prompt.
- **Against bundling:** the commit will read as "SPEC-0003 R13 + R16"
  in the log but actually carries a UNIT-2 follow-up. A reviewer
  bisecting the `describeEvent` history would have to read tick 12 to
  find this delta even though it's logically a UNIT-2 follow-up.

Severity: **NIT** (process / commit-hygiene observation, not a
correctness gap). Pattern: tick-7-style "emergency-tag at clean stopping
point" history-doc note would have captured this cleanly if the loop
had taken that route. The pre-existing-bug framing in the tick-12
prompt is accurate; no spec drift.

### Symmetry / regression checks (no findings)

- **Exhaustiveness:** `describeEvent` has 20 `case` arms for 20 event
  subtypes in `src/types/coverage.types.ts` (counted via
  `grep -c "readonly name:" src/types/coverage.types.ts` → 20 and
  `grep -c 'case "' web/src/shared.ts` → 20). Switch is exhaustive; no
  unreachable arms; the TS narrowing `e.name === "PacketSubmitted"` on
  `CoverageEvent` correctly admits access to `e.round`, `e.packetRoot`,
  `e.packetUrl`.
- **Baseline-key acceptance criterion** (`docs/progress/loop-state.md`):
  test 1 enumerates the 5 baseline keys and asserts presence in the map;
  tests 2/7/8 pin non-emptiness, headline-length ≤80, details-length
  ≥30; test 9 pins headline ≠ raw revert string. The five required
  baselines are all present and all four content quality bands pass.
- **Type-vs-map alignment:** `RevertReason` union has 32 members;
  `REVERT_REASON_MAP` literal has 32 keys; the `satisfies
  Record<RevertReason, RevertReasonEntry>` enforces every member is
  present. Adding a new revert string to the contract requires touching
  both the union and the map; the compiler will fail-loud if only one
  side moves.
- **Fallback when `reasonRaw === undefined`:** map lookup is skipped
  (the `if (reasonRaw !== undefined)` guard at line 273), fallback is
  returned with no `Raw reason:` suffix. Test 4 pins the
  non-empty-headline / non-empty-details contract on this path. **No
  `Raw reason: undefined` UI artefact.**
- **`useAction` state clears** (R13/R14 §2.3): `error` is cleared
  inside `run`, at the start of each attempt — guarantees that a
  successful retry after a failed call clears the stale error before
  the new attempt. `pending` is cleared in `finally`, so both
  resolve-paths and reject-paths re-enable the button. No timer-based
  clears; the only escape from `pending=true` is the `finally`. No
  "hidden re-arming."
- **Mutation of returned entry from `mapRevertReason`:** on the happy
  path, `mapRevertReason` returns the **same object reference** as the
  map entry (line 276: `return entry`). If a consumer mutates the
  returned `RevertReasonEntry` it mutates the shared map — same root
  cause as NIT 1. The `Readonly<...>` type + `readonly` field markers
  catch this at compile-time for TS callers.
- **PacketSubmitted arm field shape:** matches
  `src/types/coverage.types.ts:260-265` exactly. The `BigInt → string`
  template coercion is the same pattern used elsewhere in the file
  (e.g. `Settled`, `Deadlocked`). `packetUrl` is rendered untruncated;
  rationale per the prompt is that it's a content-store URL the user
  may want to copy. Defensible. (No regression vs the pre-fix file —
  the arm just didn't exist, so the switch returned `undefined` at
  runtime for `PacketSubmitted` and TS flagged the exhaustiveness gap.)
- **Comments that lie or restate code:** none found. The JSDoc on
  `useAction` (lines 9-29) accurately describes the hook's contract
  including the R14 hard-reject decision and the rationale (closure
  identity may differ across renders); the comment is load-bearing
  (explains a design choice that's not obvious from the code) and
  matches the implementation. The `revertReasonMap.ts` JSDoc on
  `mapRevertReason` accurately describes the
  matches-known-key vs fallback dichotomy; the section headers
  (`// ── createContract ────`) correctly group the entries by contract
  function and match the contract's actual revert sites. The
  `REVERT_REASON_MAP` doc comment ("Add new entries here whenever the
  contract gains a new revert path") is the maintenance directive
  paired with the `satisfies` compile-time check. Clean.

### Tick-12 verdict

**OVERALL: PASS — 0 actionable findings; 4 NITs documented.**

Severity breakdown:
- **HIGH:** 0.
- **MEDIUM:** 0.
- **LOW:** 0.
- **NIT:** 4 (Finding 1: shallow `Object.freeze` on map; Finding 2:
  `extractRevertReason` probe order makes `shortMessage` unreachable
  with ethers v6; Finding 3: test 3 only checks `headline`; Finding 4:
  `shared.ts` `PacketSubmitted` fix bundled with SPEC-0003 work as
  process / commit-hygiene observation).

`revertReasonMap.ts` enumerates every unique contract revert string
(27 unique sites collapsed to 27 keys; 32 total map entries including
5 site-duplicates for `auth: not provider` and `fee: refund failed`
that collapse to the same user-visible string — but counted by *key*
the map has 32, matching the type union). The `satisfies` check closes
the type-vs-runtime gap. The fallback embeds raw input on the
defined-but-unknown path and omits the `Raw reason:` suffix on the
undefined path. Headlines are plain English (not raw revert strings,
asserted by test 9), all ≤80 chars (test 7), details ≥30 chars
(test 8). The fee-refund / funds-* / callback-* / maxRounds-* entries
correctly include the "internal error — please contact support" /
"admin action" framing so the user understands they're not the
intended remediator. No invented entries; no missing entries.

`useAction.ts` correctly uses `useRef` (not `useState`) for the
in-flight guard, eliminating the React-state-batching window. The hard
"in-flight" reject is justified in the doc comment (closure identity
may vary across renders, coalescing is unsound). Generic type
threading is correct. The `extractRevertReason` helper is the only
NIT-worthy issue (probe order — see NIT 2).

`web/src/shared.ts` `PacketSubmitted` arm is field-shape-correct
against `src/types/coverage.types.ts:260-265`. The switch is now
exhaustive (20/20 cases for 20 event subtypes). Bundling this fix with
the SPEC-0003 work is defensible per the prompt (it was blocking the
web `tsc` gate); flagged as NIT 4 for commit-hygiene record-keeping
only.

All three required gates pass: 53/53 tests green; root `tsc` clean;
web `tsc` clean after building `dist/`. No prior tick's findings are
re-opened or regressed.

### Final tick-12 verdict: PASS (0 actionable findings; 4 NITs documented)
